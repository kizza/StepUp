A streamlined and funky digital watchface for Garmin Vivoactive 3

Check it out [on the garmin store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/ff80900f-4417-4d38-84f6-3dc9fabd0423)

(This is my first watchface development.  Was a fun little adventure to enter the Garmin developer ecosystem, grok [monkeyc](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/) as well as learn the device lifecycle.)
